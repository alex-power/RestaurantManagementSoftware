# RestaurantManagementSoftware

Also known as, RUI.

This project was created for the Processes of Object Oriented Software Development class at UCF.

RUI website was built C# MVC, Entity Framework, and a T-SQL database. 

RUI is meant to be re-deployed for each individual restaurant that wishes to use it, and allows users to interact with it both on desktop and mobile devices. This is so waitstaff can input orders on their mobile devices and kitchen staff can view orders on a larger screen. Management also has access to limited management functions and employees can clock in and out in a rudimentary way.

It does not properly use POST vs GET and doesn't actually implement the google maps API.
